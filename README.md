# Project 2: Improvements

First, I set up a better programming environment than the command line. Vim is cool, but doing a whole project in Vim was a drag. I say that as I am writing this README in Vim.

## Data Structure

How was the data structure improved?


## Algorithm

How was the algorithm improved?

## Architecture

In addition to time and space complexity improvements, I have also improved the code's structure in a few ways.

* Split source and headers into `src/` and `/inc`, respectively.
* Create new source file `process_news.cpp` which handles the file parsing.
* `TODO:` Add a testing suite

## Aggregate Analysis
